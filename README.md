## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### Devices Not Connecting?
- ‚úÖ Ensure **Test API Connection** shows success
- ‚úÖ Double-check **Room Name** (must match exactly)
- ‚úÖ Microphone permission must be granted
- ‚úÖ Restart the app if needed
- ‚úÖ Check internet connection

### Audio Not Working?
- Ensure both devices have microphone access
- Try restarting the app
- Confirm if **Demo Mode** is active (see below)

## üß™ Demo Mode

The app automatically enters Demo Mode if:
- API connection fails
- Network is unavailable
- LiveKit server is unreachable

In Demo Mode:
- You‚Äôll see **"Demo Mode - Connected"**
- Audio functionality is simulated
- Mute/unmute and end call controls behave as if connected
